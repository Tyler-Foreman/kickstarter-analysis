# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This project is meant to perform an analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for an upcoming theater project, Fever.

## Findings

In review of the Kickstarter data, specifically surrounding theater/plays in Great Britain, it is the recommendation that Louise should lower the goal for her play to under $4,000 and should aim for a goal closer to $2,000. The data shows that that the most successful theater/plays Kickstarter campaigns take place in May through July.
